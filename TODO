==setup===
    manually crop all data
    pack all crops into single image
    Make boxfile for tess input
    Train tesseract with block font
    Test block letter detection

    -Arduino linking
        set up pi side drive, rotate, arm commands
        create link between pi and arduino
        ensure the ablitiy to send and recieve messages at both ends through serial connection
        

==calibration====
    setup color filter calibration with a range of known distances on the blocks


==game logic===
    -on start
        feed known blocks rectangle into KCF or other multitracker
    -main loop
        Keep track of position and direction on board by monitoring turns and drive
        calculate path to closest known block in terms of direction and distance
        ? course correction code using tracker
        set dial to correct position
        execute pickup command
        rescan for next block in path

    -end round
        once all blocks are gathered scan for ship
        determine where ramp is
        orient at left side of ramp if possible
        orient to be straight in line with ramp
        drive forward set amount
        align block tray
        eject appropriate block into hole


    ___scan function
        scan in estimated direction of next block in major path
        Change hsv bound by distance by getting approximate hsv from range
        create high and low hsv bounds from approx
        rescan at all distaces until block is found
        if no block is found and approximate distance to next in major path block is greater than 0
        orient self in at next block and go forward 1 foot
